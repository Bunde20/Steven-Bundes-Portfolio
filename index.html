                <p>My name is Steven Bunde and I am very excited to become a software developer! 
                I have spent my professional career in the strength and conditioning industry training athletes and adults. It has
                always been a passion of mine to help clients achieve their goals no matter what they are. I am hoping to take the
                experience I have had serving my clients to the technology industry. I am looking for a new
                challenge and to become a more rounded professional.</p>
                <p>My reasoning for switching to this industry is that I have a passion for learning how 
                things work. I began my education in understanding human anatomy and physiology and 
                have now shifted my focus to computer science. I am excited to take on this new challenge
                and I can not wait to see what my future career holds. Learning how computer systems operate
                and how applications are made has always been a skill I have wanted to understand. I am hoping to one 
                day merge my knowledge of strength and conditioning and software development to create an application 
                that helps people live a happy and healthy life.
